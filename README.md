# MongoExamenTW

## Introduction

A government website that is responsible for doing official exams. The idea is a web page where the user enters their DNI / NIE and chooses the exam to do. Once selected, the exam page will open with a timer to finish it. Once the exam is finished, we will be presented with our note and it will allow us to leave or see the list of notes.

## Description

## Changelog

### Ver 0.1 - Added initial version of the project with a basic HTML and a basic class with MongoDB.
